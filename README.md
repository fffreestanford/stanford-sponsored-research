# stanford-sponsored-research

This project is intended to bring transparency about the Stanford faculty members who are continuing to work with companies engaged in disinformation and environmental injustices, specifcally fossil fuel companies and companies engaged in ongoing extraction and human rights abuses in the Congo.

Data were gathered from Stanford's SeRA database. The data set contains over 55,000 sponsored research transactions spanning from the early 20th century to date. We isolate the top 100 oil and gas publicly-traded reserve holders globally, determined by FFI Solutions. Lastly, we only include transactions that were funded (as opposed to funding rejected).

An earlier version of this data was also included in Data for Progress' 2023 Report "Accountable Allies: The Undue Influence of Fossil Fuel Money in Academia", available at https://www.dataforprogress.org/memos/accountable-allies-the-undue-influence-of-fossil-fuel-money-in-academia
